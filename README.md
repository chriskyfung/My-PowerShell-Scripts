## Usage

To use the scripts in this project, you need to have PowerShell 5.1 or later installed on your computer. The programs that you wish to use, like OneNote, theBrain, Bluestacks, etc., must also be installed on your PC.

To run a script or function, you can either open PowerShell and type the name of the script or function, or you can right-click on the script file and select “Run with PowerShell”. You may need to change the execution policy of PowerShell to allow running scripts from external sources. You can do this by typing `Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned` in PowerShell.
