## Conventions / Guidelines

The coding standards and conventions of my project are based on the [PowerShell Best Practices and Style Guide][psps-gitbooks], which is a set of guidelines and recommendations for writing clean, consistent, and maintainable PowerShell code. Some of the main points of the guide are:

-   Use **PascalCase** for function names, **camelCase** for variable names, and **UPPERCASE** for constant names.
-   Use **singular nouns** for function names and **plural nouns** for array variable names.
-   Use **approved verbs** for function names, such as `Get`, `Set`, `New`, `Remove`, etc.
-   Use **comment-based help** to document the purpose, parameters, outputs, and examples of your functions.
-   Use **spaces** instead of tabs for indentation, and use **4 spaces** per indentation level.
-   Use **curly braces** to enclose code blocks, and place them on a new line.
-   Use **double quotes** for strings that contain variables or special characters, and use **single quotes** for strings that do not.
-   Use **backticks** to escape special characters or line breaks in strings, and use **backslash** to escape backticks.
-   Use **splatting** to pass multiple parameters to a command, and use **hash tables** to store splatting arguments.
-   Use **try-catch-finally** blocks to handle errors and exceptions, and use **Write-Error** to display error messages.
-   Use **Write-Verbose** to display verbose messages, and use **Write-Debug** to display debug messages.
-   Use **Write-Output** to return the output of your functions, and use **Write-Host** to display messages to the console.
-   Use **$null** to represent an empty or non-existent value, and use **$false** and **$true** to represent boolean values.
-   Use **\-eq**, **\-ne**, **\-gt**, **\-lt**, **\-ge**, and **\-le** for comparison operators, and use **\-and**, **\-or**, and **\-not** for logical operators.
-   Use **\-match** and **\-replace** for regular expression operations, and use **\-like** and **\-contains** for wildcard operations.
-   Use **\-join** and **\-split** for string concatenation and separation, and use **+** and **\-** for numerical operations.
-   Use **Test-Path** to check the existence of a file or folder, and use **New-Item** and **Remove-Item** to create and delete files or folders.
-   Use **Get-Content** and **Set-Content** to read and write files, and use **Add-Content** and **Clear-Content** to append and clear files.
-   Use **Import-Module** and **Export-ModuleMember** to load and export modules, and use **Get-Command** and **Get-Help** to get information about commands and modules.

These are some of the coding standards and conventions of my project. You can find more details and examples in the [PowerShell Best Practices and Style Guide][psps-gitbooks]. I hope that this answer helps you to understand and follow the best practices and style of PowerShell coding. Thank you for your attention and cooperation! ðŸ˜Š
